Maybe from system.stub: get and set session id, chroot

Review and revise for [foo] [bar] vs. [foo [bar]]

file-info doesn't handle ports, need (port-fdes port)

Look for EAGAIN errnos, and create a policy if any calls error with it

Find all EINTR possibilities and retry per policy

Manually test su-ed root on OpenBSD set-file-owner/-group

Do utimensat and futimens in C for set-file-timespecs and tests for
the latter, then replace fragile closedir and if needed open/readdir.

Fix user-information and group-information, no errors reported on
Bionic Beaver, instead returning the user or group with the higest ID,
OpenBSD's group-information stub just plain broken.

Tests for user and group database access proceedures

Make note about the best security practices being a moving target
