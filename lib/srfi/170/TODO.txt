HTML: if real-path gets removed, remove "Scsh does not support the
real-path procedure." in implimentation.


Needed to match the SRFI:

Add optional buffer-mode argument to fdes->[textual|binary]-[input|output]-port

Finish call-with-temporary-filename

Parameterize perms and current-directory

Add absolute-path


Suggested enhancements:

Make appropriate procedures thread safe or thread aware

Add name of the system or library call that failed to error-errno

Improve temp-file-prefix specification and perhaps implementation

See (chibi io) for how to write a C function then wrap it in a stub

Clean up post-set testing etc. of with- and without- tty procedures
to match with-raw-mode

Use [...]at functions to handle long file paths.
